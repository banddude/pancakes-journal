# Rachel Korea Trip - Letter Style Guide

## Overview
These are love letters from Mike to Rachel while she's in Korea for two weeks (Feb 1-14, 2026). They document Kit's daily life but are written as letters Rachel will treasure.

## Tone
- **Wartime letter home** - Romantic, longing, slightly formal but personal
- **"My Dearest Rachel"** - Use this opening every time
- **Sign off with**: "I love you." then "Love, Mike"
- Not a journal recap - a love letter that happens to tell stories

## Writing Rules
1. **Complete sentences only** - No fragments, no dashes as sentence starters
2. **Don't over-explain** - Rachel knows context. Don't tell her things she was there for unless it transitions to something new she doesn't know
3. **Acknowledge shared knowledge** - Write like you know what she knows
4. **No melodrama clichés** - "I'm already a mess" / "let it all out" / "too quiet" are lazy
5. **Don't embellish** - Use what Mike actually said, don't invent motivations or feelings he didn't express
6. **No "Here's the big moment"** - Let moments speak for themselves
7. **Don't say things like "you would've been proud"** - Feels cruel when she's away

## Structure
- Open with emotional/romantic section (the wartime letter feel)
- Transition to daily activities with Kit
- End with countdown and love

## Counting Days
- Day 1: "13 more days"
- Count down each day
- Valentine's Day is the return - acknowledge its significance romantically, not cheesily

## Examples of Good Phrasing
- "Two weeks. You're going to be gone two weeks. A fortnight, 14 days."
- "I barely made it back to the car before I started crying. I sat there and let myself cry for a bit before I started home."
- "The drive home was quiet."

## Examples of Bad Phrasing
- "I drove you to the airport" (flat, lifeless)
- Incomplete sentences used for dramatic effect
- Over-explaining logistics she already lived through
