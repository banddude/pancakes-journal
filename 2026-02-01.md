**Day 1 - Rachel leaves for Korea**

## Letter to Rachel

My Dearest Rachel,

Two weeks. You're going to be gone two weeks. A fortnight, 14 days. You've only just left and I'm already counting. I barely made it back to the car before I started crying. I sat there and let myself cry for a bit before I started home. The drive home was quiet. I stopped at La Colombe for coffee on the way.

You'll be home on Valentine's Day. I'm counting the days already.

Kit stayed back with Gam Gam, who's here visiting for the week. When I got home, I took them to Bubble Planet. I lost my hat in the ball pit this time, but it only took me 15 minutes to find it. They made us sign a waiver this time and asked about balloon allergies, which was new and kind of weird.

After that we went to Arts District and played skee-ball and ate lunch. Kit made a 40-point shot.

We headed home to grab Pancake so we could go to Riverside Park, but Kit changed her mind on the way so we went to Chevy instead. She played with Gam Gam at the park while Pancake got dragged around behind her. As we were leaving, Arion, Alex, and Danny showed up so we put on our pads and started skating.

Kit dropped in with me with no hands at all. She took a pretty hard slam first but she got right back up and did it. A bunch of people clapped for her. She showed so much perseverance and determination today.

Arion got hit with a scooter in the back of his head but thankfully he was wearing his helmet.

We came home and ate leftovers for dinner. Kit did bath time and bedtime with Gam Gam and she was asleep by 7:45.

13 more days.

I love you.

Love,
Mike
